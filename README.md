## Design of the webpage ##
### Design decisions ###

Given that restaurant is in the middle of the Atlantic ocean on a small island covered with the palm trees, idea was to include lots of teal, blue, aquamarine, green. Some red and yellow was used so that we have contrast and increase visibility for the vision impared customers.

### Fonts ###

Nothing too specific was used and I decided to go with more "common" fonts
Used "lato", "Oswald", "sour-gummy"

### Structure ###

To match the style of casual I decided to go wtih straighforward and simpler approach. 
Making it complex with lots of dropdowm menus (despite consuming less space) is more complex and therefor alignment is getting compormised more easier.

I went with approach that each section has seperate webpage, but user can always return to main page or anz other 4 pages available from the top (all 5 pages have consistent look/appearance) 

Home page / Main Page and on top are
- Food Menu
- Contact
- Reward centar (loyalty program)
- About us
Same is repeated when user selects any of the "child" webpages as  other pages, including home page, are shown on the top.
